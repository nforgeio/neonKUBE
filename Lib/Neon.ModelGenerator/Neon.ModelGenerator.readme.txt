The [Neon.ModelGenerator] package includes the [neon-modelgen] command line
tool that can be used to convert simple class and struct definitions into 
model classes that can be easily serialized and deserialized from JSON and/or
implement INotifyPropertyChanged for UX integration.  [neon-modelgen] can
also generate REST clients the same way.

After referencing this package in your project, you'll need to manually edit
your project file adding [GeneratePathProperty=true] to the package reference
and then add a build target to call [neon-modelgen] to have it generate the
model source code.

STEP 1: Add [GeneratePathProperty=true] to your package reference:
------------------------------------------------------------------

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Neon.ModelGenerator" Version="2.11.0" GeneratePathProperty="true">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

Adding this causes MSBuild to define the $(PkgNeon_ModelGenerator) variable 
which will reference the directory where the package is persisted in your
workstation's global package cache, as described here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#generatepathproperty

STEP 2: Add a pre-build target that uses [neon-modelgen] to generate your models:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  <Target Name="ModelGen" BeforeTargets="Compile">
    <Exec Command="&quot;$(PkgNeon_ModelGenerator)\contentFiles\any\netstandard2.0\win-x64\neon-modelgen&quot; -ux foo.dll foo.cs" />
  </Target>

This example executes the [win-x64] version of [neon-modelgen] located in the cached package
directory, having it read model definitions from [foo.dll] and write the generated models 
to [foo.cs].  Note that you'll generally reference the source assembly from another project's
build output and you'll need to configure your build dependencies such that the source
project builds first.

We add surround the command path with [&quot;] to handle the case where path may include
spaces.  The $(PkgNeon_ModelGenerator) variable will expand into a reference to the folder
where the package is cached.  The remaining path references a specific build of [neon-modelgen].

The [Neon.ModelGenerator] includes three versions [neon-modelgen] for [linux-x64], [osx-x64] and [win-x64].
You need to select the correct one for your build environment by editing the last directory name.

Here's some documentation for the underlying model generator class as well as the [neon-modelgen]
command line tool itself:

neon-modelgen
-------------
Generates C# source code for data and service models defined as interfaces
within a compiled assembly.

USAGE:

    neon-modelgen [OPTIONS] ASSEMBLY-PATH [OUTPUT-PATH]

ARGUMENTS:

    ASSEMBLY-PATH       - Path to the assembly being scanned.

    OUTPUT-PATH         - Optional path to the output file, otherwise
                          the generated code will be written to STDOUT.

OPTIONS:

    --source-namespace=VALUE    - Specifies the namespace to be used when
                                  scanning for models.  By default, all
                                  classes within the assembly wll be scanned.

    --target-namespace=VALUE    - Specifies the namespace to be used when
                                  generating the models.  This overrides 
                                  the original type namespaces as scanned
                                  from the source assembly.

    --persisted                 - Generate database persistence related code.

                                  NOTE: This only supports Couchbase

    --ux=xaml                   - Generate additional code for the specified
                                  UX framework.  Currently, only [xaml] is
                                  supported

    --no-services               - Don't generate any service clients.

    --targets=LIST              - Specifies the comma separated list of target 
                                  names.  Any input models that are not tagged
                                  with one of these names will not be generated.

    --debug-allow-stepinto      - Indicates that generated class methods will
                                  not include the [DebuggerStepThrough]
                                  attribute allowing the debugger to step
                                  into the generated methods.

    --v1compatible              - Generates models using the v1.x compatible
                                  ""__T"" property name rather than ""T$$""
                                  which is generated by ModelGen v2+.

    --log=PATH                  - Optionally outputs any errors to the specified 
                                  log file and supresses potentially spurious
                                  from the standard output and exit code.

REMARKS:

This command is used to generate enhanced JSON based data models and
REST API clients suitable for applications based on flexible noSQL
style design conventions.  See this GitHub issue for more information:
