**neonSDK:** A new home for general purpose libraries.

We're expecting neonKUBE to be ready for a public preview in Sept/Oct 2022 and one of our TODOs has 
been to relocate the general purpose Neon libraries to their own GitHub repo since these will be versioned
independently from neonKUBE.  We finally relocated the non **Neon.Kube.*** libraries to:

[neonSDK repo](https://github.com/nforgeio/neonSDK)
