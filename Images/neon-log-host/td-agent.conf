#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configures [neon-log-host] containers that will be deployed to every 
# cluster node with the responsibility to receive local log events from the:
#
#       * Node's TD-Agent service which captures journald events
#       * Docker container events forwarded by the Fluentd plugin
#       * Container events transmitted as Syslog packets for containers
#         that don't support Docker logging (like HAProxy).
#
# The agent then adds cluster and node fields to describe the datacenter, 
# environment, node, etc. and then forwards the events on to the cluster 
# [neon-log-collector] log aggregator service.
#
# See the [neon-log-collector] image's [td-agent.conf] configuration file
# for more details.
#
# NOTE: This configuration depends on several environment variables having
#       been loaded from [/etc/neoncloud/env-host] by the container 
#       entrypoint script.
#
# Debugging TD-Agent Configurations
# ---------------------------------
# I've found it best to manually configure one or more TD-Agent instances
# directly on a temporary cluster's node to form a pipeline and then mess
# directly with the configurations there, rather than trying to build and 
# deploy Docker containers.
#
# TD-Agent is not installed on NeonCluster nodes so you should run the
# following commands to install the agent and some relevant plugins:
#
#   docker rm -f neon-log-host
#   curl -4L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-xenial-td-agent2.sh | sh
#   /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-systemd -v 0.0.4 --no-document
#   /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch --no-document
#   /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-record-modifier --no-document
#   mkdir -p /var/neon-log-host
#
# You'll also have to manually patch the configurations to work by tweaking 
# the ports and addresses while debugging and copy any custom plugin Ruby
# scripts to: [/etc/td-agent/plugin/].
